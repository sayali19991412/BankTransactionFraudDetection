# BankTransactionFraudDetection

➡️ Now a days Bank transactions usage has been drastically increased across the world, now people believe in going cashless and are completely dependent on online transactions.
➡️ We propose a Machine learning model to detect fraudulent Bank transactions activities in online financial transactions.
➡️ The pre-processing of the dataset is done by using PySpark and pipeline is created using Azure Databricks and Azure Blob is used for storage. 
➡️ The ML model is developed On Databricks workspace and visualized using PowerBI. 
➡️ The classification model is trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships between these features and the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.
